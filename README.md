# bun-template-blank

This is a bun blank template with some of the most useful things to get me started. This template includes the following:

- Github Actions to run linting, tests, releases, etc on CI
- Setup of Bun tests, can be switched to vitest or jest by adding configuration files later
- Husky to maintain local enforcement of rules (removable through package.json scripts)
- Brewfile to add bun to a machine if not present yet
- Basic typescript setup through tsconfig.json
